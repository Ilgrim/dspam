UPGRADING FROM 3.2 

At the moment, no critical changes to the installation. Just...

configure && make && make install

...over your old copy. You may, however, wish to scan for differences in
the included dspam.conf to ensure they're propagated into your production
configuration.

If you have no already done so from 3.2.4, you may wish to create the following
index if you are using PostgreSQL. This index is unnecessary, but prevents
PostgreSQL's query builder from getting confused, which leads to more time
consuming queries:

CREATE INDEX id_token_data_04 ON dspam_token_data(uid);
