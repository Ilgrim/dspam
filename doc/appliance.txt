Configuring DSPAM as a seamless front-end relay using Postfix

This HOWTO explains how to set up DSPAM as a front-end relay, or "appliance".
Using this configuration, you can point your MX records to the DSPAM server and
then have DSPAM pass along any valid email to your mail server. The example
provided also provides personalized training for each user it is protecting,
even if users have multiple email aliases. This allows you to create more than
just a dumb gateway server, but something smart enough to learn each user's
mail. The drawback to this is that you need to account for all addresses 
behind your mail server, but you'll find by the end of this exercise that it's
not very difficult to maintain. 

When configuring DSPAM as a relay/appliance, it's generally a good idea to set 
up DSPAM on its own server. Therefore, we will assume you've got a fresh server
running *NIX with an existing MySQL 4.1+ installation. 

Step 1: Configure, compile and install Postfix with MySQL support

To do this, you'll need to init a set of makefiles including the path to your
MySQL includes and libraries...

make -f Makefile.init makefiles \
    'CCARGS=-DHAS_MYSQL -I/usr/local/mysql/include' \
    'AUXLIBS=-L/usr/local/mysql/lib -lmysqlclient -lz -lm'

Then simply

make && make install

Step 2: Configure, compile  and install DSPAM with daemon + mysql support

You'll need the following options:
  MySQL
  Virtual Users
  Daemon mode

It may also be a good idea to enable:
  Preferences extension
  Debug

For example:

./configure     --with-storage-driver=mysql_drv \
                --with-mysql-libraries=/usr/local/mysql/lib \
                --with-mysql-includes=/usr/local/mysql/include \
                --enable-virtual-users \
                --enable-preferences-extension \
                --enable-daemon 

Step 3: Install DSPAM MySQL Objects (With a twist)

Create the MySQL objects as outlined in the mysql DSPAM doc, but use the 
following SQL call to create the virtual uid table. This basically creates a
table without a primary key, which we're going to use to manually create any
aliases we need:

create table dspam_virtual_uids (
  uid smallint not null,
  username varchar(128) not null
) type=MyISAM;

create unique index id_virtual_uids_01 on dspam_virtual_uids(username);

You can also find this script in src/tools.mysql_drv/virtual_user_aliases.sql

Step 4: Configure DSPAM to receive LMTP and delivery SMTP

We're going to configure postfix to connect to DSPAM via LMTP using a domain
socket. The following configuration properties shoudl be set in dspam.conf:

ServerQueueSize		32
ServerPID		/var/run/dspam.pid
ServerMode		standard
ServerParameters	"--deliver=innocent"
ServerIdent		"localhost.localdomain"
ServerDomainSocketPath	/tmp/dspam.sock

You'll also want to use the following ParseToHeader parameters:

ParseToHeaders on
ChangeModeOnParse on
ChangeUserOnParse off

This prevents Postfix from needing to use any aliases for retraining. When
users email spam-name@domain.com, DSPAM will automatically realize that it
needs to retrain the message. I'll explain how to set this up in a bit.

Step 5: Configure Postfix to use DSPAM + virtual UIDs table

The following is a sample configuration that will tell postfix to use DSPAM
as its virtual transport (passing all mail to DSPAM via LMTP) and to use the
dspam_virtual_uids table as its source for mailbox aliases. You can build on
this and add mysql support for virtual_mailbox_domains, but you'll need to
maintain your own database table for that.

virtual_transport = lmtp:unix:/tmp/dspam.sock
virtual_mailbox_domains = mydomain.com
virtual_mailbox_maps = mysql:/etc/postfix/vmailbox.cf

Step 6: Configure user aliases in dspam_virtual_uids

Postfix is now set up to do a lookup in dspam_virtual_uids. It _must_ find a
valid address in this table in order to accept the message. What you'll need
to do now is to create email addresses (and spam addresses) in this table
for each user behind your mail server. You will need to assign any aliases
under the same UID, and you'll also need to create a spam alias in this
table. For example:

UID	Username
1	jonathan@nuclearelephant.com
1	spam-jonathan@nuclearelephant.com
1	jon@nuclearelephant.com			<- An alias 
1	jonz@nuclearelephant.com		<- Another alias	

When any of these destination addresses is specified, DSPAM will process
mail under the same user so that only one database is used for all of these
addresses. You can create as many aliases as you like, and in fact should 
probably write a script to pull this from your existing production system.

Congratulations! You're now set up. You can start DSPAM using dspam --daemon.
You might want to run with verbose debug to test and ensure everything is
working properly.
