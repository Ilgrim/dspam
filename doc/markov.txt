To implement Markovian weighting, the following pieces must be configured:

1. The storage driver. Be sure and compile using Bill Yerazunis' CRM114
   Sparse Spectra driver (crm_drv). This is the only driver that is presently
   fast enough to handle the extra data generated by the tokenizer used.

2. The tokenizer. This is set via 'Features' and is defaulted to 'chained'. 
   Comment out chained and use 'sbph' instead. This implements Bill
   Yerazunis' (CRM114) Sparse Binary Polynomial Hashing tokenizer, which is
   used in Markovian weighting.

3. The value computing algorithm. This should be set to 'markov' which uses
   Markovian weighting. Comment out graham.

4. The combination algorithm (Algorithm). This should be set to 'graham'. 
   Comment out 'burton'

This implements the "standard" CRM114ish Markovian type discrimination, but
you could also mix and match different tokenizers and combination algorithms
if you wanted to play around. It's quite possible you may get better results
from using a different combo. The only thing that is certain is the value
computing algorithm should always be 'markov'.
