To implement Markovian weighting, there are three pieces that need to be
configured:

1. The tokenizer. This is set via 'Features' and is defaulted to 'chained'. 
   Comment out chained and use 'sbph' instead. This implements Bill
   Yerazunis' (CRM114) Sparse Binary Polynomial Hashing tokenizer

2. The value computing algorithm. This should be set to 'markov' which uses
   Markovian weighting.

3. The combination algorithm (Algorithm). This should be set to 'graham'

This implements the "standard" CRM114ish Markovian type discrimination, but
you could also mix and match different tokenizers and combination algorithms
if you wanted to play around. It's quite possible you may get better results
from using a different combo. The only thing that is certain is the value
computing algorithm should always be 'markov'.
