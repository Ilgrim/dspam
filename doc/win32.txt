Win32 Build Supplement for DSPAM

Win32 is not officially supported (yet) but with the included supplement,
most major components can be built on Windows systems. Some tools can be 
built as well but have limited usefulness.

Although DSPAM builds on win32, integrating it with some mail server is a
completely different issue. No documentation is yet available for integrating
DSPAM with any windows mail server software. If you are wanting to run DSPAM
with exchange, your best bet is still to look at running it as a gateway or
as a POP3 proxy.

You will need Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1 or later, as previous versions do not
support the 'long long' C99 type. If you are building using a different
compiler, you'll need to create your own project and build.

INSTRUCTIONS

1. You will require the SQLite 2.x library, which is the default storage driver
   for DSPAM. You can download it from http://www.sqlite.org/download.html
   and build using the same options as used by dspam.vcproj file, mainly
   use /MD[d] option for CRT. You will also need to add paths to the directory
   containing sqlite.h and sqlite[d].lib ("d" should be used for the debug
   version) to the "VC++ Directories", under "Projects" in "Tools|Options"
   dialog in Visual C++ IDE or to INCLUDE and LIB environment variables.

2. Copy the following files from src/win32 into the DSPAM sourcetree (src/):

auto-config.h.win32-msvc
dir_win32.h
dspam_agent.vcproj
dspam.sln
dspam_stats.vcproj
dspam.vcproj
example.vcproj
util_win32.c

   This is only necessary until win32 support becomes official.

3. You may now open the dspam.sln workspace or one of the projects
   (dspam.vcproj, dspam_agent.vcproj, etc) in Visual C++ and build normally. 

4. To compile any other tools, it is simpler to use one of the following 
   commands in a DOS window:

    cl /Zi /MDd /DDEBUG /DHAVE_CONFIG_H /I. sqlited.lib debug\dspam.lib file.c

   for a debug version or

    cl /MD /DHAVE_CONFIG_H /I. sqlite.lib release\dspam.lib file.c

   for release version, where file.c is the name of the tool you wish to
   build. This may also be used to build the agent if you don't wish to
   use the included project files.

After further testing/feedback, win32 may be officially supported in future
versions. Please mail any Win32-specific questions to vz-dspam@zeitlins.org or
the dspam-dev mailing list.
