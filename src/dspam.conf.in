## dspam.conf -- DSPAM configuration file
##

#
# DSPAM Home: Specifies the base directory to be used for DSPAM storage
#
Home @dspam_home@

#
# Trusted Delivery Agent: Specifies the local delivery agent DSPAM should call 
# when delivering mail as a trusted user. Use %u to specify the user DSPAM is 
# processing mail for. It is generally a good idea to allow the MTA to specify 
# the pass-through arguments at run-time, but they may also be specified here.
#
# Most operating system defaults:
#TrustedDeliveryAgent "/usr/bin/procmail"       # Linux
#TrustedDeliveryAgent "/usr/bin/mail"           # Solaris
#TrustedDeliveryAgent "/usr/libexec/mail.local" # FreeBSD
#TrustedDeliveryAgent "/usr/bin/procmail"       # Cygwin
#
# Other popular configurations:
#TrustedDeliveryAgent "/usr/cyrus/bin/deliver"	# Cyrus
#TrustedDeliveryAgent "/bin/maildrop"		# Maildrop
#TrustedDeliveryAgent "/usr/local/sbin/exim -oMr spam-scanned $u" # Exim
#
TrustedDeliveryAgent "@delivery_agent@"

#
# Untrusted Delivery Agent: Specifies the local delivery agent and arguments
# DSPAM should use when delivering mail and running in untrusted user mode.
# Because DSPAM will not allow pass-through arguments to be specified to 
# untrusted users, all arguments should be specified here. Use %u to specify
# the user DSPAM is processing mail for. This configuration parameter is only 
# necessary if you plan on allowing untrusted processing.
#
#UntrustedDeliveryAgent "/usr/bin/procmail -d %u"

#
# Quarantine Agent: DSPAM's default behavior is to quarantine all mail it 
# thinks is spam. If you wish to override this behavior, you may specify
# a quarantine agent which will be called with all messages DSPAM thinks is
# spam. Use %u to specify the user DSPAM is processing mail for.
#
#QuarantineAgent	"/usr/bin/procmail -d spam"

#
# OnFail: What to do if local delivery or quarantine should fail. If set
# to "unlearn", DSPAM will unlearn the message prior to exiting with an
# un successful return code. The default option, "error" will not unlearn
# the message but return the appropriate error code. The unlearn option
# is use-ful on some systems where local delivery failures will cause the
# message to be requeued for delivery, and could result in the message
# being processed multiple times. During a very large failure, however, 
# this could cause a significant load increase.
#
OnFail error

# Trusted Users: Only the users specified below will be allowed to perform
# administrative functions in DSPAM such as setting the active user and
# accessing tools. All other users attempting to run DSPAM will be restricted;
# their uids will be forced to match the active username and they will not be
# able to specify delivery agent privileges or use tools.
#
Trust root
Trust mail
Trust mailnull 
Trust smmsp
Trust daemon
#Trust nobody
#Trust majordomo

#
# Debugging: Enables debugging for some or all users. IMPORTANT: DSPAM must
# be compiled with debug support in order to use this option. DSPAM should
# never be running in production with debug active unless you are 
# troubleshooting problems.
#
# DebugOpt: One or more of: process, classify, spam, fp, inoculation, corpus
#   process     standard message processing
#   classify    message classification using --classify
#   spam        error correction of missed spam
#   fp          error correction of false positives
#   inoculation message inoculations (source=inoculation)
#   corpus      corpusfed messages (source=corpus)
#
#Debug *
#Debug bob bill
#
#DebugOpt process spam fp

#
# Training Mode: The default training mode to use for all operations, when
# one has not been specified on the commandline or in the user's preferences.
# Acceptable values are: toe, tum, teft, notrain
#
TrainingMode teft

#
# Features: Specify features to activate by default; can also be specified
# on the commandline. See the documentation for a list of available features.
# If _any_ features are specified on the commandline, these are ignored.
#
#Feature sbph
Feature chained
Feature tb=4
Feature whitelist
Feature noise

#
# Algorithms: Specify the statistical algorithms to use, overriding any
# defaults configured in the build. The options are:
#    graham      Graham-Bayesian ("A Plan for Spam")
#    burton      Burton-Bayesian (SpamProbe)
#    robinson    Robinson's Geometric Mean Test (Obsolete)
#    chi-square  Fisher-Robinson's Chi-Square Algorithm
#
# You may have multiple algorithms active simultaneously, but it is strongly
# recommended that you group Bayesian algorithms with other Bayesian
# algorithms, and any use of Chi-Square remain exclusive.
#
# Don't mess with this unless you know what you're doing
#
#Algorithm chi-square
Algorithm graham burton

#
# PValue: Specify the technique used for calculating PValues, overriding any
# defaults configured in the build. These options are:
#    graham      Graham's Technique ("A Plan for Spam")
#    robinson    Robinson's Technique 
#
# Unlike algorithms, you may only have one of these defined. Use of the
# chi-square algorithm automatically changes this to robinson.
#
# Don't mess with this unless you know what you're doing.
#
#PValue robinson
PValue graham

#
# Preferences: Specify any preferences to set by default, unless otherwise
# overridden by the user (see next section) or a default.prefs file.
# If user or default.prefs are found, none of these preferences are
# loaded.
#
Preference "spamAction=quarantine"
Preference "signatureLocation=message"	# 'message' or 'headers'
Preference "showFactors=on"
#Preference "spamAction=tag"
#Preference "spamSubject=SPAM"

#
# Overrides: Specifies the user preferences which may override configuration
# and commandline defaults. Any other preferences supplied by an untrusted user
# will be ignored.
#
AllowOverride trainingMode
AllowOverride spamAction spamSubject
AllowOverride statisticalSedation
AllowOverride enableBNR
AllowOverride enableWhitelist

#
# Storage driver settings: Specific to a particular storage driver. Uncomment
# the configuration specific to your installation, if applicable.
#

#MySQLPort
#MySQLUser 	     	dspam
#MySQLPass    		changeme

# If you're running DSPAM in client/server (daemon) mode, uncomment the
# setting below to override the default connection cache size (the number
# of connections the server pools between all clients).
#

#
# Optionally, you can specify storage profiles, and specify the server to
# use on the commandline with --profile. For example:
#
#Profile DECAlpha
#MySQLServer.DECAlpha   10.0.0.1
#MySQLPort.DECAlpha     3306
#MySQLUser.DECAlpha     dspam
#MySQLPass.DECAlpha     changeme
#MySQLDb.DECAlpha       dspam
#MySQLCompress.DECAlpha true
#
#Profile Sun420R
#MySQLServer.Sun420R    10.0.0.2
#MySQLPort.Sun420R      3306
#MySQLUser.Sun420R      dspam
#MySQLPass.Sun420R      changeme
#MySQLDb.Sun420R        dspam
#MySQLCompress.Sun420R  false
#
#DefaultProfile DECAlpha

#
# If you're using storage profiles, you can set failovers for each profile.
# Of course, if you'll be failing over to another database, that database
# must have the same information as the first. If you're using a global
# database with no training, this should be relatively simple. If you're
# configuring per-user data, however, you'll need to set up some type of
# replication between databases.
#
#Failover.DECAlpha      SUN420R
#Failover.Sun420R       DECAlpha

# If the storage fails, the agent will follow each profile's failover up to
# a maximum number of failover attempts. This should be set to a maximum of
# the number of profiles you have, otherwise the agent could loop and try
# the same profile multiple times (unless this is your desired behavior).
#
#FailoverAttempts       1

#
# Ignored headers: If DSPAM is behind other tools which may add a header to
# incoming emails, it may be beneficial to ignore these headers - especially
# if they are coming from another spam filter. If you are _not_ using one of
# these tools, however, leaving the appropriate headers commented out will
# allow DSPAM to use them as telltale signs of forged email.
#
#IgnoreHeader X-Spam-Status
#IgnoreHeader X-Spam-Scanned
#IgnoreHeader X-Virus-Scanner-Result

#
# Notifications: Enable the sending of notification emails to users (first
# message, quarantine full, etc.)
#
Notifications	on

#
# Purge configuration: Set dspam_clean purge default options, if not otherwise
# specified on the commandline
#
PurgeSignatures 14          # Stale signatures
PurgeNeutral    30          # Tokens with neutralish probabilities
PurgeUnused     60          # Unused tokens
PurgeHapaxes    15          # Tokens with less than 5 hits (hapaxes)
PurgeHits1S	10          # Tokens with only 1 spam hit

#
# Local Mail Exchangers: Used for source address tracking, tells DSPAM which
# mail exchangers are local and therefore should be ignored in the Received:
# header when tracking the source of an email. Note: you should use the address
# of the host as appears between brackets [ ] in the Received header.
#
LocalMX 127.0.0.1

#
# Logging: Disabling logging for users will make usage graphs unavailable to
# them. Disabling system logging will make admin graphs unavailable.
#
SystemLog on
UserLog   on

#
# TrainPristine: for systems where the original message remains server side 
# and can therefore be presented in pristine format for retraining. This option
# will cause DSPAM to cease all writing of signatures and DSPAM headers to the 
# message, and deliver the message in as pristine format as possible. This mode
# REQUIRES that the original message in its pristine format (as of delivery) 
# be presented for retraining, as in the case of webmail, imap, or other 
# applications where the message is actually kept server-side during reading, 
# and is preserved. DO NOT use this switch unless the original message can be 
# presented for retraining with the ORIGINAL HEADERS and NO MODIFICATIONS.
#
#TrainPristine on

#
# Opt: in or out; determines DSPAM's default filtering behavior. If this value
# is set to in, users must opt-in to filtering by dropping a .dspam file in
# /var/dspam/opt-in/user.dspam (or if you have homedirs configured, a .dspam
# folder in their home directory).  The default is opt-out, which means all 
# users will be filtered unless a .nodspam file is dropped in 
# /var/dspam/opt-out/user.nodspam
#
Opt out

#
# TrackSources: specify which (if any) source addresses to track and report
# them to syslog (mail.info). This is useful if you're running a firewall or
# blacklist and would like to use this information. Spam reporting also drops
# SBL blacklist files (see http://www.nuclearelephant.com/projects/sbl/). 
#
#TrackSources spam nonspam

#
# ParseToHeaders: When retraining, it's possible to set up a wildcard such
# as *@spam.yourdomain.com to intercept all missed spam. If you do this,
# you'll need to enable this option so that the username is assigned based
# on the To: address of the message; for example spam-bob will assign the
# username to bob.
#
#ParseToHeaders on

#
# Broken MTA Options: Some MTAs don't support the proper functionality
# necessary. In these cases you can activate certain features in DSPAM to
# compensate. 'returnCodes' causes DSPAM to return an exit code of 99 if
# the message is spam, 0 if not, or a negative code if an error has occured.
# Specifying 'case' causes DSPAM to force the input usernames to lowercase.
# Spceifying 'lineStripping' causes DSPAM to strip ^M's from messages passed
# in.
#
#Broken returnCodes
#Broken case
#Broken lineStripping

#
# MaxMessageSize: You may specify a maximum message size for DSPAM to process.
# If the message is larger than the maximum size, it will be delivered 
# without processing. Value is in bytes.
#
#MaxMessageSize 4194304

#
# Daemonized Server: If you are running DSPAM as a daemonized server using
# --daemon, the following parameters will override the default. Use the
# ServerPass option to set up accounts for each client machine. The DSPAM
# server will process and deliver the message based on the parameters 
# specified. If you want the client machine to perform delivery, use
# the --stdout option in conjunction with a local setup. 
#
#ServerPort		24
#ServerQueueSize	32
#ServerPass.Relay1	"secret"
#ServerPass.Relay2	"password"
#ServerPID		/var/run/dspam.pid

# If you wish to use a local domain socket instead of a TCP socket, uncomment
# the following. It is strongly recommended you use local domain sockets if
# you are running the client and server on the same machine, as it eliminates
# much of the bandwidth overhead.
#
#ServerDomainSocketPath  "/tmp/dspam.sock"

#
# Client Mode: If you are running DSPAM in client/server mode, uncomment and
# set these variables.
