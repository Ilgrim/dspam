ABOUT

pgsql_drv is a PostgreSQL storage driver for DSPAM. This driver enables DSPAM
to read and write all token, signature, and statistics data from a PostgreSQL 
database. The advantages of using a SQL backend are obvious:

- Centralized data storage
- Structured queries for information
- No need for context locking mechanisms

REQUIREMENTS

pgsql_drv storage driver requires PostgreSQL version 7.3 or higher.

CONFIGURING DSPAM

To configure DSPAM to use pgsql_drv, use the following arguments while running
DSPAM's configure:

--with-storage-driver=pgsql_drv
Tells DSPAM to use the pgsql_drv driver

--with-pgsql-libraries=/path/to/libs
Tells DSPAM where to find the Postgres client libraries.  They are usually
located in /usr/local/pgsql/lib

--with-pgsql-includes=/path/to/libs
Tells DSPAM where to find the Postgres headers.  They are usually located in
/usr/local/pgsql/include

--enable-virtual-users
Tells DSPAM to create virtual user ids for each dspam user.  Use this if your
users don't really exist on the system (e.g. via getpwuid) or if you're doing
something weird like sharing uids.

After configure has successfully finished, build and install DSPAM using the
instructions from DSPAM's readme.

CREATING PGSQL OBJECTS

Before pgsql_drv will function, you must run pgsql_objects.sql file
(located in the same directory as this readme) to create the table objects
required by the driver.

If you plan on enabling virtual users (something you'll need to do if the users
don't actually exist on your system), also run virtual_users.sql.

NOTE: If you plan on having more than 32,768 users, you'll want to change
smallint to int for all uid fields.

CREATING A CONNECT DATA FILE

pgsql_drv needs to know how to connect to your PostgreSQL database. You will
need to specify this in dspam.conf. The file should already contain an example
as shown below:

PgSQLServer    127.0.0.1
PgSQLPort      5432
PgSQLUser      dspam
PgSQLPass      changeme
PgSQLDb        dspam

Or if you'd like to connect using /tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432, use:

PgSQLServer    /tmp
PgSQLPort      
PgSQLUser      dspam
PgSQLPass      changeme
PgSQLDb        dspam

DSPAM checks to see if the first character of the HOSTNAME field is a slash,
and if so will treat it like a socket file.

NIGHTLY PURGE

If you would like to purge the many stale tokens DSPAM will have lying around 
the database, you should run one of the provided purge scripts nightly. The 
dspam_clean tool may also be used for deeper cleansing.  See DSPAM's README 
for more information about the dspam_clean tool.  

If you are supporting TOE-mode users on your system, you will want to do one
of the following:

  1. TOE-Mode a user preference

     If you will support TOE-mode as a user option (preference), it is
     recommended that you enable preferences-extension support and recompile,
     then use the purge-pe.sql script nightly. The preferences-extension will 
     store user preferences in the database so that Postgres can query them.

     NOTE: You should add a preference for any global users on your system, so
     that their data is purged as if TOE-based (since global user data is
     rarely updated). You can do this using:
                                                                                
     dspam_admin add pref [username] trainingMode TOE

  2. Global TOE Support

     If you will be using TOE mode globally (for all users), then you should
     use purge.sql, but remove the following lines:

     DELETE FROM dspam_token_data
       WHERE CURRENT_DATE - last_hit > 90;

     This will prevent the purging of stale tokens, which could cause serious
     data loss in TOE databases (because tokens are never touched unless
     an error has occured).  All other purges should be safe even for TOE-mode
     users.

If you will NOT be supporting TOE users on your system, you may simply run
the purge.sql script nightly, as-is.

ERRORS

Any SQL errors will be reported to /tmp/sql.errors as well as the standard
syslog facilities (although the query will be truncated).
